## Data Exploration in Python

### Dataset Overview
We begin by loading the dataset into a DataFrame named `tordata`. Displaying the initial data provides a snapshot of the contents.

- `tordata.dtypes` lists all data types within the DataFrame.
- `tordata.mo` displays data pertaining to different months.

### Visual Analysis
1. **Monthly Data Distribution**
   - A histogram showing data distribution by month.
   - Data values sorted in ascending order indicate the arrangement of months.
     

2. **Relationship Between Month and Magnitude**
   - The relationship is depicted through a detailed graph showing trends and outliers.

3. **State-wise Analysis**
   - Ohio (OH) shows the highest average injuries, while Massachusetts (MA) shows the highest average fatalities.
   - Texas (TX) experiences a higher percentage (13%) of tornado occurrences compared to other states such as Kansas (KS), Oklahoma (OK), and Florida (FL).

4. **Temporal Trends**
   - December records the highest number of tornadoes, suggesting an increase towards the year's end.
   - Over the years, there is a visible increase in tornado occurrences.

5. **Boxplot Analysis**
   - A boxplot provides a statistical summary for different years, emphasizing Texas as the state with the most tornadoes and December as the most prone month.

## Visualizations


### Conclusion
The analysis underscores the importance of data analytics in understanding and preparing for tornado occurrences. Without this collected data, identifying tornado-prone months and states would be challenging. This information allows for better preparedness and precautionary measures.
